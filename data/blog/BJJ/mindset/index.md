I finished my first week of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I've been very focused on the physical techniques, but I just had my first breakthroughs with my mindset.

## Fighting

This is learning what it's like to fight, not just technique and exercise. Half of my motivation for getting into BJJ was for the exercise, and when I'm on the mats everything is so new that I've been overwhelmed focusing on learning technique. The fighting mindset is just as important I think, and I'm going to work on that next week.

Someone pointed out that the moments when I'm uncomfortable or hurting are the moments that are most realistic to a real fight. They're precious learning moments that are hard to simulate or rehearse. I need to take advantage of them, and learn to control my mind. Controlling my mind will enable me to use techniques.
